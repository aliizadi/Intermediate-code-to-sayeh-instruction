This is the simple code generator for sayeh.

Compiling from C to intermediate code is done by the project compiler_design_three_address_codegenerator(compiler_design_three_address_codegenerator) thanks to Hrishikesh Goyal.

Converting from intermediate code to sayeh(https://github.com/aliizadi/Sayeh-basic-computer) was implemented by me for the course computer architecture.

Source code of second part is available in folder sayeh instruction generator.
